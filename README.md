# SimpleAlarmInput
Simple alarm in Python, input directly the duration to countdown from the moment it sets off. 
Most alarm application requires more complex input such as time/clock/date of when will it goes off. I can't find simpler ones, so i make my own that's faster & easier to configure for my need.
Serve as a reminder for simple short duration stuff such as leaving the stove on for cooking, etc.

# Audio
Audio is converted to base64 in order to make it possible to embed it into a single executable, better portability. The string is then used to recreate the audio as temporary file
