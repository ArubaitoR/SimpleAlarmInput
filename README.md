# SimpleAlarmInput
Simple alarm in Python, input in minutes or hours. 

Most alarm application requires more complex input such as time/clock/date of when will it goes off. I can't find simpler ones, so i make my own that's faster & easier to configure for my need.

Serve as a reminder for simple short duration stuff such as leaving the stove on for cooking, etc.
